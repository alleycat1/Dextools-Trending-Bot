The advantage of this bot over others is that it is open source. With this tool, you don't need paid proxy services, and you don't have to pay anyone for trending.
The bot utilizes TorProxy, a software component that enhances privacy and security. 
TorProxy allows you to route your internet traffic through the Tor network, providing anonymity and preventing your IP address from being easily traced.
This feature ensures a higher level of privacy while using the bot and adds an extra layer of protection for your online activities.
As a result, you don't need any paid proxy services.

## Usage

- After the page loads, if the Cloudflare page appears, wait for the browser verification to finish.
- Click the checkbox "Start Trending Loop (Press If There Is No Cloudflare Detection)."

That's all.
